# What is dynamic binding

- In C++, dynamic binding, also known as runtime polymorphism or late binding, is a feature that allows a program to determine which function to call at runtime based on the type of the object being used. It allows a derived class to override a method of its base class so that the method called depends on the type of the object at runtime, rather than at compile time.
- Dynamic binding is achieved through the use of virtual functions. A virtual function is a member function of a base class that can be overridden by a derived class. When a virtual function is called using a pointer or reference to an object of a derived class, the function that is executed is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object.
- Dynamic binding is useful in situations where you want to provide a common interface for a set of related classes, but allow each class to implement the interface in its own way. This allows you to write code that works with objects of any of the related classes, without having to know the exact type of the object at compile time.

# What is function overload resolution

- Function overload resolution is a process in C++ where the compiler determines which function to call when there are multiple functions with the same name but different parameters. This process is also known as function overloading.

- When a function is called in C++, the compiler looks for a function with the same name and the correct number and types of parameters. If there is only one such function, that function is called. However, if there are multiple functions with the same name, the compiler needs to determine which one to call based on the arguments passed to the function.

The process of function overload resolution involves several steps:

1. The compiler creates a set of candidate functions that have the same name as the function being called.

2. The compiler eliminates any functions that are not viable based on the number or types of arguments being passed.

3. The compiler ranks the remaining functions in the set based on a set of rules defined by the language standard. These rules include considerations such as the exact match of arguments, conversion of arguments, default arguments, and the use of template arguments.

4. If there is a clear best match, that function is called. If there are multiple functions that are equally good matches, the compiler generates an error.

- Function overload resolution allows programmers to define multiple functions with the same name, making their code more readable and intuitive. It is an important feature of C++, as it allows for more flexibility and expressive power when designing software.

# What is user defined conversion

- User-defined conversions in C++ refer to the process of defining a conversion function within a class to enable the object of that class to be converted to another type. This process is also known as type conversion or type casting.

- In C++, you can define a user-defined conversion function using the syntax:

```CPP
operator target_type() const;
```
> where target_type is the type you want to convert your class to. This function can be defined as a member function of the class or a non-member function that takes an object of the class as its argument.

- For example, consider the following class:

```CPP
class MyInt {
public:
    int value;
    MyInt(int v) : value(v) {}
};
```
- To enable objects of this class to be converted to integers, we can define a user-defined conversion function like this:

```CPP
class MyInt {
public:
    int value;
    MyInt(int v) : value(v) {}
    operator int() const { return value; }
};

```
- This allows us to use objects of the MyInt class as if they were integers, such as:

```CPP
MyInt x(42);
int y = x;

```
> In this example, the user-defined conversion function operator int() const is called to convert the object x of the MyInt class to an integer y.

- User-defined conversions can be powerful tools in C++, but they should be used with caution as they can sometimes lead to unexpected results and make code harder to read and maintain. It is generally recommended to use them sparingly and only when they make the code more readable and understandable.

# What is inline expension

- Inline expansion in C++ is a feature that allows the compiler to replace a function call with the actual code of the function at the point where the function is called. This is done by using the inline keyword to suggest to the compiler that the function should be expanded inline.
- When a function is called normally in C++, the program must save the current execution context and jump to the code of the function. After the function completes, the program must restore the execution context and continue executing from where it left off. This process incurs some overhead, particularly for small, frequently called functions.
- By using the inline keyword, the compiler is instructed to replace the function call with the actual code of the function at the point where the function is called. This can reduce the overhead of the function call and improve performance, particularly for small, frequently called functions.

**For example, consider the following code:**
```CPP
inline int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}

int main() {
    int result = square(5);
    return 0;
}
```
- In this example, the square() function is marked as inline using the inline keyword. When the function is called in the main() function, the compiler will replace the function call with the actual code of the function, resulting in code that is equivalent to:

```CPP
int main() {
    int result = 5 * 5;
    return 0;
}

```
> This can result in faster and more efficient code, particularly for small, frequently called functions.

- It's worth noting that the use of inline is a suggestion to the compiler, and the compiler may choose to ignore the suggestion if it determines that inlining the function would not be beneficial. Additionally, inlining can result in larger executable size, so it should be used judiciously, particularly for larger functions.

# What is loop unrolling

- Loop unrolling in C++ is an optimization technique where the compiler replaces a loop with a sequence of instructions that perform the same operation multiple times. This reduces the overhead of loop control, such as loop counter updates and conditional branches, and can result in faster and more efficient code.

- In loop unrolling, the compiler takes a loop that looks like this:

```CPP
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // loop body
}

```
- And transforms it into a sequence of instructions that look like this:

```CPP
for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 4) {
    // loop body for i
    // loop body for i + 1
    // loop body for i + 2
    // loop body for i + 3
}

```
- In this example, the loop has been unrolled by a factor of 4, meaning that the loop body is executed 4 times for each iteration of the loop counter. This can improve performance by reducing the overhead of the loop control instructions.

- Loop unrolling is particularly effective for loops with a small number of iterations, as the overhead of loop control can dominate the actual work performed by the loop. However, unrolling a loop can also increase the size of the code, so it should be used judiciously and only when it is likely to provide a performance benefit.

- In C++, loop unrolling can be performed automatically by the compiler using various optimization flags or manually by the programmer using techniques such as template metaprogramming or recursion.

# is "loop unrolling" an inline expension?

- Loop unrolling is not the same as inline expansion, although they are related optimization techniques that can improve the performance of C++ code.
- Inline expansion involves replacing a function call with the actual code of the function at the point where the function is called, which can reduce the overhead of the function call and improve performance. On the other hand, loop unrolling involves replacing a loop with a sequence of instructions that perform the same operation multiple times, which can reduce the overhead of loop control and improve performance.
- While both techniques can result in faster and more efficient code, they are applied at different levels of the code. Inline expansion is applied to functions, while loop unrolling is applied to loops. Additionally, inline expansion is performed automatically by the compiler when the function is marked as inline, while loop unrolling can be performed automatically or manually by the compiler or the programmer.
- In summary, loop unrolling and inline expansion are distinct optimization techniques that can be used together or separately to improve the performance of C++ code.

# what is generic programming paradigm

- Generic programming is a programming paradigm in C++ that emphasizes the creation of reusable code that can work with multiple data types and data structures. In this paradigm, algorithms and data structures are designed in a way that is independent of the specific types of data they will be used with, allowing them to be reused with different types of data.

- The key features of generic programming in C++ include templates, function objects, and generic algorithms.

- **Templates:** Templates are a powerful feature in C++ that allow you to define functions and classes that work with multiple data types. A template is a blueprint for creating a function or class, with placeholders for the actual data types to be used. When the template is instantiated with specific data types, the compiler generates the appropriate code.

- **Function Objects:** Function objects, also known as functors, are objects that behave like functions. They can be defined with templates and can work with multiple data types. Function objects are often used with generic algorithms to provide customized behavior.
- **Generic Algorithms:** Generic algorithms are algorithms that can work with different data types and data structures. Examples include sorting, searching, and copying algorithms. Generic algorithms are designed to work with any data type that meets certain requirements, such as being iterable.

- By using templates, function objects, and generic algorithms, C++ allows you to write reusable code that can work with a wide range of data types and data structures. This can result in more efficient and flexible code, as well as reducing the amount of code duplication.

# so what is "paradigm" exactly

- In computer programming, a paradigm is a fundamental style or approach to designing and coding software systems. It is a set of principles and practices that guide the programmer in solving problems and creating software solutions.

- Different paradigms have different approaches to organizing code, structuring data, and defining relationships between program components. Some common paradigms in programming include:

- **Procedural programming:** A paradigm in which programs are composed of procedures or functions that perform specific tasks.

- **Object-oriented programming:** A paradigm in which programs are composed of objects that have data and behavior, and can interact with each other through messages or methods.

- **Functional programming:** A paradigm in which programs are composed of functions that are treated as first-class objects, and can be used to compose other functions.

- **Event-driven programming:** A paradigm in which programs are driven by events, such as user input or system notifications, that trigger specific actions or functions.

- Each paradigm has its own strengths and weaknesses, and is best suited for different types of problems and software systems. Programmers may choose to use one or more paradigms in a given project, depending on the requirements and constraints of the project.

# so when i declare a function with "inline", then  i say "compiler, just use the declaration of this function here"

- Yes, when you declare a function with the inline keyword in C++, you are essentially telling the compiler to substitute the function call with the actual body of the function at the call site (where the function is called), instead of generating a separate function call instruction.

- This can result in faster code execution because the overhead of calling a function (such as pushing and popping values on the stack) is eliminated, and the compiler can perform additional optimizations on the inlined code.

- However, it's important to note that the inline keyword is just a hint to the compiler, and it's up to the compiler to decide whether to actually inline the function or not. Additionally, inlining a function can lead to larger executable size and longer compilation times, so it's typically best to use inline judiciously and only for small, frequently-used functions.


# why the functions which is declared in classes are implicitly inline?

- In C++, member functions declared inside a class definition are treated as inline functions by default. This is because member functions defined inside a class are usually small and frequently used, and the overhead of a function call can be significant for performance-critical code. By defaulting to inline, the compiler can optimize the code by eliminating the overhead of a function call and potentially generating more efficient code.

- Note that this behavior only applies to member functions that are defined inside the class definition, not to functions that are merely declared inside the class definition and later defined outside the class definition. If you define a member function outside the class definition, you can still mark it as inline explicitly using the inline keyword, or the compiler may choose to inline it anyway based on its own optimization decisions.

# Why do i have to say to compiler something like that with inline keyword? Compiler thinks more efficient than human brain

- While it's true that modern compilers are very sophisticated and can perform many optimizations automatically, there are still cases where providing hints to the compiler can improve the efficiency of the resulting code. Inlining is one such case.

- Even though a compiler may be able to determine on its own that a function should be inlined, providing the inline keyword explicitly can serve as a stronger hint to the compiler that inlining is desirable. This can be especially useful in cases where the function is larger or more complex than the compiler's threshold for automatic inlining, or in cases where you want to ensure that a particular function is inlined even if the compiler might not have chosen to inline it automatically.

- In addition to providing hints to the compiler, the inline keyword also serves as a signal to other programmers who read the code that the function is designed to be inlined and that it may be called frequently. This can help improve the readability and maintainability of the codebase.

# Even though "not inlining"more efficient, when i declare it an inline function, what compilers do in thsat situation?

- When you declare a function as inline in C++, it is essentially a request to the compiler to consider inlining the function. However, the compiler may choose to ignore the request and generate a non-inlined function for various reasons.

- For example, if the function is too large or complex to be inlined efficiently, the compiler may decide not to inline it. Additionally, if the function is not frequently called, or if it is used in a context where inlining would not improve performance, the compiler may choose not to inline it.

- In cases where the compiler does not inline a function that has been declared as inline, the function will be treated as a regular non-inline function, and a separate function call instruction will be generated whenever the function is called. In other words, declaring a function as inline does not guarantee that it will be inlined, but it does give the compiler the option to inline it if it deems it appropriate.

# If there is a function declared in class with a huge code, will compiler still use it like an inline function?

- The inline keyword in C++ is just a hint to the compiler to consider inlining the function, but it does not guarantee that the function will be inlined. The decision to inline a function or not is ultimately up to the compiler, and is based on a variety of factors, including the size and complexity of the function, the number of times it is called, and the optimization settings of the compiler.

- If a member function of a class has a large and complex code, it is possible that the compiler may decide not to inline it, even if it is declared with the inline keyword. In such cases, the function will be treated as a regular non-inline function, and a separate function call instruction will be generated whenever the function is called.

- It's worth noting that even if the compiler decides not to inline a function that is declared as inline, the function can still be optimized in other ways, such as through function-level optimization or link-time optimization. Additionally, modern compilers are able to make increasingly sophisticated decisions about inlining, and may choose to inline even large or complex functions in certain circumstances.

# what is one definition rule (ODR)

- The One Definition Rule (ODR) is a fundamental rule in C++ that specifies that every entity (such as a variable, function, or class) in a C++ program must have exactly one definition across all translation units in which it is used. In other words, if a particular entity is defined in more than one translation unit, the program has undefined behavior.

- The ODR is enforced by the linker, which is responsible for resolving symbols (such as function or variable names) across multiple object files and libraries to create a final executable. If the linker encounters multiple definitions of the same entity, it will produce an error and fail to create the executable.

- To adhere to the ODR, it is common practice to declare entities in header files and define them in source files, to ensure that they are only defined once across all translation units that use them. Additionally, C++ provides several mechanisms for controlling the visibility of entities across translation units, such as the static keyword for variables and functions, and the inline keyword for functions.

# so what will happen when i use inline keyword? Does it adhere to the ADR?

- When you use the inline keyword on a function in C++, it does not affect the One Definition Rule (ODR). The ODR still applies, and every entity (including functions) must have exactly one definition across all translation units in which it is used.

- However, the inline keyword does provide a way to define a function in a header file, which can be included in multiple translation units without violating the ODR. This is because the inline keyword tells the compiler that the function definition may be replicated in multiple translation units, and that it should be treated as a candidate for inlining instead of generating a separate function for each translation unit.

- If a function is declared as inline and defined in a header file that is included in multiple translation units, the compiler will typically generate identical copies of the function code in each translation unit, but the linker will treat them as a single function definition. This is because the inline keyword effectively allows the function to be defined multiple times, as long as each definition is identical, and as long as the function is not odr-used (that is, its address is not taken).

- Therefore, using the inline keyword can help to avoid linker errors when defining functions in header files, but it does not exempt them from the ODR.

# what does mean constexpr keyword 

- The constexpr keyword in C++ is used to indicate that a variable or function can be evaluated at compile-time, and its value will be a constant expression. This means that the value of a constexpr variable or function is known at compile-time, and it can be used in contexts where a constant expression is required, such as array sizes, template arguments, and switch statements.

- Variables declared as constexpr must be initialized with a constant expression, and the value of the expression must be computable at compile-time. Functions declared as constexpr must have a single return statement, and their parameters and return types must also be able to be evaluated at compile-time.

**Here is an example of using constexpr:**

```CPP
constexpr int factorial(int n) {
    return (n <= 1) ? 1 : (n * factorial(n-1));
}

int main() {
    constexpr int n = 5;
    int arr[factorial(n)]; // array size is computed at compile-time
    return 0;
}

```
> In this example, the factorial function is declared as constexpr, which means it can be used in a context where a constant expression is required. In main, the n variable is declared as constexpr, and the array size is computed using the factorial function at compile-time.

- Using constexpr can help improve performance and reduce memory usage, as the values of constants are known at compile-time, and do not need to be computed at run-time.

# what is happening if i use constexpr in function definition

- If you use the constexpr keyword in a function definition in C++, it means that the function is a candidate for evaluation at compile-time. This means that the function may be used to compute a constant expression, and its result will be a compile-time constant.

- If a function is declared as constexpr and its arguments are also constant expressions, then the function may be evaluated at compile-time. In this case, the function is evaluated by the compiler during the compilation process, and the result is substituted directly into the code that uses the function.

**Here is an example of using constexpr in a function definition:**

```CPP
constexpr int add(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
}

int main() {
    constexpr int a = 5;
    constexpr int b = 7;
    constexpr int c = add(a, b); // evaluated at compile-time
    return 0;
}

```

- In this example, the add function is declared as constexpr, and it takes two integer arguments. In main, the a and b variables are declared as constexpr, and the add function is called with a and b as arguments to compute c. Since a and b are constant expressions, the add function is evaluated at compile-time, and its result is substituted directly into the code.

- Using constexpr in function definitions can help to improve performance and reduce memory usage, as constant expressions are known at compile-time and do not need to be computed at run-time. However, it is important to note that not all functions can be declared as constexpr. Functions that perform I/O, use dynamic memory allocation, or have side effects cannot be evaluated at compile-time and cannot be declared as constexpr.

# compiler know how to improve performance better than me. So why do we using constexpr

- You are correct that the compiler knows how to optimize code better than most programmers. However, there are situations where the use of constexpr can provide benefits beyond what the compiler can do on its own.

- One major advantage of constexpr is that it allows certain computations to be performed at compile-time instead of run-time. This can lead to faster execution times and reduced memory usage. For example, imagine that you have a function that computes a hash value at run-time, which is called frequently throughout your program. By making the function constexpr, the hash computation can be done once at compile-time, and the result can be substituted into the program code, rather than re-computing the hash each time the function is called.

- Another advantage of constexpr is that it provides compile-time error checking for certain types of computations. For example, if you have a function that computes the size of an array based on its contents, you can make the function constexpr to ensure that the computation is performed at compile-time, and that any errors in the computation will be caught by the compiler before the program is even run.

- Finally, the use of constexpr can make code easier to understand and maintain, especially in cases where a constant value is used in multiple places throughout the program. By making the value constexpr, you can ensure that it is only computed once, and that all uses of the value are consistent with each other.

- Overall, while the compiler is certainly capable of optimizing code on its own, the use of constexpr can provide additional benefits in terms of performance, error checking, and code maintainability.

# so once i use constexpr in function definition, i made it to be calculated in compile time right

- Yes, that's correct. When you use the constexpr keyword in a function definition, you are telling the compiler that the function can be evaluated at compile-time for constant expressions, which means that the result of the function can be computed by the compiler before the program is even run.

- This can be useful for performance optimization, as it avoids the overhead of runtime function calls, and can also help catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime. Additionally, constexpr functions can be used in other contexts where constant expressions are required, such as array sizes or template arguments.

# what are differences between class and structs

- In C++, class and struct are both used to define custom data types, but they have some differences in terms of their default access control and inheritance.

- The primary difference between class and struct is in their default access control. In a class, the default access level is private, meaning that all members declared within the class are by default private, unless otherwise specified. In contrast, in a struct, the default access level is public, meaning that all members declared within the struct are by default public, unless otherwise specified.

- Another difference is in their use for inheritance. When using class, the base class inheritance is by default private, while when using struct, it's public. You can use the public, private and protected access modifiers to specify the level of access for members and inheritance in both class and struct.

- In terms of their capabilities, class and struct are almost identical. Both can contain member functions, constructors, destructors, and data members. They can both be used to define objects, and can be used interchangeably in most cases.

- In practice, the choice between class and struct is largely a matter of style and convention. In some coding communities, it's common to use struct for simple data structures that don't have much behavior, and class for more complex objects with behavior and encapsulation. However, this is just a convention and you can use either class or struct depending on your coding style and preference.
