# what is dynamic bindin in c++

- In C++, dynamic binding, also known as runtime polymorphism or late binding, is a feature that allows a program to determine which function to call at runtime based on the type of the object being used. It allows a derived class to override a method of its base class so that the method called depends on the type of the object at runtime, rather than at compile time.
- Dynamic binding is achieved through the use of virtual functions. A virtual function is a member function of a base class that can be overridden by a derived class. When a virtual function is called using a pointer or reference to an object of a derived class, the function that is executed is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object.
- Dynamic binding is useful in situations where you want to provide a common interface for a set of related classes, but allow each class to implement the interface in its own way. This allows you to write code that works with objects of any of the related classes, without having to know the exact type of the object at compile time.
