# What is dynamic binding

- In C++, dynamic binding, also known as runtime polymorphism or late binding, is a feature that allows a program to determine which function to call at runtime based on the type of the object being used. It allows a derived class to override a method of its base class so that the method called depends on the type of the object at runtime, rather than at compile time.
- Dynamic binding is achieved through the use of virtual functions. A virtual function is a member function of a base class that can be overridden by a derived class. When a virtual function is called using a pointer or reference to an object of a derived class, the function that is executed is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object.
- Dynamic binding is useful in situations where you want to provide a common interface for a set of related classes, but allow each class to implement the interface in its own way. This allows you to write code that works with objects of any of the related classes, without having to know the exact type of the object at compile time.

# What is function overload resolution

- Function overload resolution is a process in C++ where the compiler determines which function to call when there are multiple functions with the same name but different parameters. This process is also known as function overloading.

- When a function is called in C++, the compiler looks for a function with the same name and the correct number and types of parameters. If there is only one such function, that function is called. However, if there are multiple functions with the same name, the compiler needs to determine which one to call based on the arguments passed to the function.

The process of function overload resolution involves several steps:

1. The compiler creates a set of candidate functions that have the same name as the function being called.

2. The compiler eliminates any functions that are not viable based on the number or types of arguments being passed.

3. The compiler ranks the remaining functions in the set based on a set of rules defined by the language standard. These rules include considerations such as the exact match of arguments, conversion of arguments, default arguments, and the use of template arguments.

4. If there is a clear best match, that function is called. If there are multiple functions that are equally good matches, the compiler generates an error.

- Function overload resolution allows programmers to define multiple functions with the same name, making their code more readable and intuitive. It is an important feature of C++, as it allows for more flexibility and expressive power when designing software.

# What is user defined conversion

- User-defined conversions in C++ refer to the process of defining a conversion function within a class to enable the object of that class to be converted to another type. This process is also known as type conversion or type casting.

- In C++, you can define a user-defined conversion function using the syntax:

```CPP
operator target_type() const;
```
> where target_type is the type you want to convert your class to. This function can be defined as a member function of the class or a non-member function that takes an object of the class as its argument.

- For example, consider the following class:

```CPP
class MyInt {
public:
    int value;
    MyInt(int v) : value(v) {}
};
```
- To enable objects of this class to be converted to integers, we can define a user-defined conversion function like this:

```CPP
class MyInt {
public:
    int value;
    MyInt(int v) : value(v) {}
    operator int() const { return value; }
};

```
- This allows us to use objects of the MyInt class as if they were integers, such as:

```CPP
MyInt x(42);
int y = x;

```
> In this example, the user-defined conversion function operator int() const is called to convert the object x of the MyInt class to an integer y.

- User-defined conversions can be powerful tools in C++, but they should be used with caution as they can sometimes lead to unexpected results and make code harder to read and maintain. It is generally recommended to use them sparingly and only when they make the code more readable and understandable.

# What is inline expension

- Inline expansion in C++ is a feature that allows the compiler to replace a function call with the actual code of the function at the point where the function is called. This is done by using the inline keyword to suggest to the compiler that the function should be expanded inline.
- When a function is called normally in C++, the program must save the current execution context and jump to the code of the function. After the function completes, the program must restore the execution context and continue executing from where it left off. This process incurs some overhead, particularly for small, frequently called functions.
- By using the inline keyword, the compiler is instructed to replace the function call with the actual code of the function at the point where the function is called. This can reduce the overhead of the function call and improve performance, particularly for small, frequently called functions.

**For example, consider the following code:**
```CPP
inline int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}

int main() {
    int result = square(5);
    return 0;
}
```
- In this example, the square() function is marked as inline using the inline keyword. When the function is called in the main() function, the compiler will replace the function call with the actual code of the function, resulting in code that is equivalent to:

```CPP
int main() {
    int result = 5 * 5;
    return 0;
}

```
> This can result in faster and more efficient code, particularly for small, frequently called functions.

- It's worth noting that the use of inline is a suggestion to the compiler, and the compiler may choose to ignore the suggestion if it determines that inlining the function would not be beneficial. Additionally, inlining can result in larger executable size, so it should be used judiciously, particularly for larger functions.

# What is loop unrolling

- Loop unrolling in C++ is an optimization technique where the compiler replaces a loop with a sequence of instructions that perform the same operation multiple times. This reduces the overhead of loop control, such as loop counter updates and conditional branches, and can result in faster and more efficient code.

- In loop unrolling, the compiler takes a loop that looks like this:

```CPP
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // loop body
}

```
- And transforms it into a sequence of instructions that look like this:

```CPP
for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 4) {
    // loop body for i
    // loop body for i + 1
    // loop body for i + 2
    // loop body for i + 3
}

```
- In this example, the loop has been unrolled by a factor of 4, meaning that the loop body is executed 4 times for each iteration of the loop counter. This can improve performance by reducing the overhead of the loop control instructions.

- Loop unrolling is particularly effective for loops with a small number of iterations, as the overhead of loop control can dominate the actual work performed by the loop. However, unrolling a loop can also increase the size of the code, so it should be used judiciously and only when it is likely to provide a performance benefit.

- In C++, loop unrolling can be performed automatically by the compiler using various optimization flags or manually by the programmer using techniques such as template metaprogramming or recursion.

# is "loop unrolling" an inline expension?

- Loop unrolling is not the same as inline expansion, although they are related optimization techniques that can improve the performance of C++ code.
- Inline expansion involves replacing a function call with the actual code of the function at the point where the function is called, which can reduce the overhead of the function call and improve performance. On the other hand, loop unrolling involves replacing a loop with a sequence of instructions that perform the same operation multiple times, which can reduce the overhead of loop control and improve performance.
- While both techniques can result in faster and more efficient code, they are applied at different levels of the code. Inline expansion is applied to functions, while loop unrolling is applied to loops. Additionally, inline expansion is performed automatically by the compiler when the function is marked as inline, while loop unrolling can be performed automatically or manually by the compiler or the programmer.
- In summary, loop unrolling and inline expansion are distinct optimization techniques that can be used together or separately to improve the performance of C++ code.

# what is generic programming paradigm

- Generic programming is a programming paradigm in C++ that emphasizes the creation of reusable code that can work with multiple data types and data structures. In this paradigm, algorithms and data structures are designed in a way that is independent of the specific types of data they will be used with, allowing them to be reused with different types of data.

- The key features of generic programming in C++ include templates, function objects, and generic algorithms.

- **Templates:** Templates are a powerful feature in C++ that allow you to define functions and classes that work with multiple data types. A template is a blueprint for creating a function or class, with placeholders for the actual data types to be used. When the template is instantiated with specific data types, the compiler generates the appropriate code.

- **Function Objects:** Function objects, also known as functors, are objects that behave like functions. They can be defined with templates and can work with multiple data types. Function objects are often used with generic algorithms to provide customized behavior.
- **Generic Algorithms:** Generic algorithms are algorithms that can work with different data types and data structures. Examples include sorting, searching, and copying algorithms. Generic algorithms are designed to work with any data type that meets certain requirements, such as being iterable.

- By using templates, function objects, and generic algorithms, C++ allows you to write reusable code that can work with a wide range of data types and data structures. This can result in more efficient and flexible code, as well as reducing the amount of code duplication.

# so what is "paradigm" exactly

- In computer programming, a paradigm is a fundamental style or approach to designing and coding software systems. It is a set of principles and practices that guide the programmer in solving problems and creating software solutions.

- Different paradigms have different approaches to organizing code, structuring data, and defining relationships between program components. Some common paradigms in programming include:

- **Procedural programming:** A paradigm in which programs are composed of procedures or functions that perform specific tasks.

- **Object-oriented programming:** A paradigm in which programs are composed of objects that have data and behavior, and can interact with each other through messages or methods.

- **Functional programming:** A paradigm in which programs are composed of functions that are treated as first-class objects, and can be used to compose other functions.

- **Event-driven programming:** A paradigm in which programs are driven by events, such as user input or system notifications, that trigger specific actions or functions.

- Each paradigm has its own strengths and weaknesses, and is best suited for different types of problems and software systems. Programmers may choose to use one or more paradigms in a given project, depending on the requirements and constraints of the project.

# so when i declare a function with "inline", then  i say "compiler, just use the declaration of this function here"

- Yes, when you declare a function with the inline keyword in C++, you are essentially telling the compiler to substitute the function call with the actual body of the function at the call site (where the function is called), instead of generating a separate function call instruction.

- This can result in faster code execution because the overhead of calling a function (such as pushing and popping values on the stack) is eliminated, and the compiler can perform additional optimizations on the inlined code.

- However, it's important to note that the inline keyword is just a hint to the compiler, and it's up to the compiler to decide whether to actually inline the function or not. Additionally, inlining a function can lead to larger executable size and longer compilation times, so it's typically best to use inline judiciously and only for small, frequently-used functions.


# why the functions which is declared in classes are implicitly inline?

- In C++, member functions declared inside a class definition are treated as inline functions by default. This is because member functions defined inside a class are usually small and frequently used, and the overhead of a function call can be significant for performance-critical code. By defaulting to inline, the compiler can optimize the code by eliminating the overhead of a function call and potentially generating more efficient code.

- Note that this behavior only applies to member functions that are defined inside the class definition, not to functions that are merely declared inside the class definition and later defined outside the class definition. If you define a member function outside the class definition, you can still mark it as inline explicitly using the inline keyword, or the compiler may choose to inline it anyway based on its own optimization decisions.

# Why do i have to say to compiler something like that with inline keyword? Compiler thinks more efficient than human brain
