# What is dynamic bindin in c++

- In C++, dynamic binding, also known as runtime polymorphism or late binding, is a feature that allows a program to determine which function to call at runtime based on the type of the object being used. It allows a derived class to override a method of its base class so that the method called depends on the type of the object at runtime, rather than at compile time.
- Dynamic binding is achieved through the use of virtual functions. A virtual function is a member function of a base class that can be overridden by a derived class. When a virtual function is called using a pointer or reference to an object of a derived class, the function that is executed is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object.
- Dynamic binding is useful in situations where you want to provide a common interface for a set of related classes, but allow each class to implement the interface in its own way. This allows you to write code that works with objects of any of the related classes, without having to know the exact type of the object at compile time.

# What is function overload resolution in c++

- Function overload resolution is a process in C++ where the compiler determines which function to call when there are multiple functions with the same name but different parameters. This process is also known as function overloading.

- When a function is called in C++, the compiler looks for a function with the same name and the correct number and types of parameters. If there is only one such function, that function is called. However, if there are multiple functions with the same name, the compiler needs to determine which one to call based on the arguments passed to the function.

The process of function overload resolution involves several steps:

1. The compiler creates a set of candidate functions that have the same name as the function being called.

2. The compiler eliminates any functions that are not viable based on the number or types of arguments being passed.

3. The compiler ranks the remaining functions in the set based on a set of rules defined by the language standard. These rules include considerations such as the exact match of arguments, conversion of arguments, default arguments, and the use of template arguments.

4. If there is a clear best match, that function is called. If there are multiple functions that are equally good matches, the compiler generates an error.

- Function overload resolution allows programmers to define multiple functions with the same name, making their code more readable and intuitive. It is an important feature of C++, as it allows for more flexibility and expressive power when designing software.
